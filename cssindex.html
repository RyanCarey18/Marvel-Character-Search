            Wolverine clan, the most insane father and son team in the Marvel

            important villainess Bruce Banner's ever faced. Who is the Harpy?

            claw in a gamma-powered deathmatch? Stone might bleed, feathers
            might fly, and hearts might break in the highest stakes battle yet
            for Banner and Son! Plus, The Savage SHE-HULK continues her quest to
            find Jennifer Walters in a back-up by Fred Van Lente and Michael
